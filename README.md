# This is the repository of the final project from the Project 4 course, Information System collage at UFRPE

It was made using nodejs and the AWS services such as lambda functions, s3 bucket and kinesis.

The serverless framework is used to automate deploy and integrations with the AWS cloud services.

I used postman for API testing.
